# 🔥 Firebase Authentication Setup - Complete!

## ✅ What Was Done

Your EcoNova Factory app is now connected to **real Firebase Authentication**!

### Changes Made:

1. **Firebase Configuration** (`src/utils/firebase.js`)
   - Added your Firebase project credentials
   - Initialized Firebase app with your config
   - Enabled Firebase Auth and Realtime Database

2. **Authentication Updates**
   - Updated Login page to use Firebase Auth functions
   - Updated Sidebar logout to use Firebase signOut
   - Updated AppContext to use Firebase auth state listener

3. **Removed Mock Auth**
   - Disabled the demo/mock authentication system
   - Now using real Firebase authentication

## 🔐 How to Use

### First Time Setup - Create an Account

1. **Go to the login page** (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Click "Don't have an account? Register"**
3. **Enter your email and password**
   - Example: `admin@econova.com`
   - Password: Choose a secure password (min 6 characters)
4. **Click "Create Account"**
5. You'll be automatically logged in and redirected to `/home`

### Subsequent Logins

1. **Go to the login page**
2. **Enter your registered email and password**
3. **Click "Sign In"**
4. You'll be redirected to the dashboard

## 🎯 Firebase Console

You can manage users in your Firebase Console:
- **URL**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/econova-962d3
- **Go to**: Authentication → Users
- **Here you can**:
  - View all registered users
  - Delete users
  - Disable/enable users
  - Reset passwords

## 🔒 Security Notes

Your Firebase configuration is now in the code. For production:

1. **Move credentials to environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file
   - Move the Firebase config values there
   - Use `import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY` etc.

2. **Set up Firebase Security Rules**:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Realtime Database → Rules
   - Configure who can read/write data

3. **Enable Firebase App Check** (optional):
   - Protects your backend from abuse
   - Go to Firebase Console → App Check

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Email already in use" error
- This email is already registered
- Use the "Sign In" option instead
- Or use a different email

### "Wrong password" error
- Check your password
- Use the password you set during registration
- You can reset it in Firebase Console

### "User not found" error
- This email hasn't been registered yet
- Click "Don't have an account? Register"

### Can't sign in after registration
- Make sure Email/Password authentication is enabled in Firebase Console
- Go to: Authentication → Sign-in method → Email/Password → Enable
