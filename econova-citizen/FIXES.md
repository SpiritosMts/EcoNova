# EcoNova Citizen - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Location Permissions Error ✓
**Problem:** App crashed when sending reports with error: "No location permissions are defined in the manifest"

**Solution:** Added required permissions to AndroidManifest.xml:
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` - For precise location
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` - For approximate location  
- `INTERNET` - For network requests

**File:** `/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

### 2. Empty Map - No Pollution Zones ✓
**Problem:** Map displayed empty with no pollution areas, unlike the factory website

**Solution:** 
- Created `pollution_zones.dart` with predefined pollution zones matching the factory website data
- 10 pollution zones across Gabes area:
  - 3 Critical zones (Industrial District North, Factory Complex South, Chemical Plant Zone)
  - 4 Warning zones (Coastal Area East, Port District, Downtown Area, Market Area)
  - 3 Moderate zones (Residential Zone West, Agricultural Area, University District)
- Updated map screen to display these zones on load
- Zones now show as colored circles with proper radius based on pollution level

**Files Created:**
- `/lib/utils/pollution_zones.dart` - Zone data and color utilities

**Files Modified:**
- `/lib/screens/map_screen.dart` - Added pollution zones display logic

## Features

### Map Display
- **Pollution Zones:** 10 predefined zones matching factory website
- **Color Coding:**
  - Yellow: Moderate (0-40%)
  - Orange: Warning (40-70%)
  - Red: Critical (70-100%)
- **Interactive:** Tap zones to see details (name, pollution level, trend, safety tips)
- **User Reports:** Also displays user-submitted reports (when available)

### Now Working
✅ Location permissions granted
